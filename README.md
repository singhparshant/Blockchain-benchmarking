- First comprehensive profiling and benchmarking study of the **NEAR Protocol**
- Identified gaps in prior benchmarking frameworks (Diablo, Gromit), which did not evaluate NEAR
- Deployed and operated a **local NEAR network** for controlled experimentation
- Designed and executed benchmarks using **locally deployed smart contracts**
- Measured key performance metrics:
    - Throughput
    - Transaction latency
    - Impact of sharding
- Produced quantitative analysis with plots and visualizations to surface performance limits and trade-offs
- Provided independent performance insights beyond foundation-published metrics
- Contributed a reproducible benchmarking methodology for future blockchain evaluations

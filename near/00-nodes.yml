# this option creates tcpdump services for iperf server/clients and send_udp source/sinks.
# for send_udp, you need to add a extra redundant send_udp service to the node at the end of the flow  with role: sink and flow and port defined
# example: - { name: send_udp, role: sink, flow: 1, port: 1005 }
# tcpdump file name should be "p{port}"

# Load the nodes for a pre-defined topology and its node mapping

# 2. Option
# Define your own required hosts and their mapping
